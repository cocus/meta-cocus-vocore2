### Shell environment set up for builds. ###

You can now run 'bitbake core-image-custom'

You could in theory use any of the common targets:
    core-image-minimal
    core-image-full-cmdline
    core-image-sato
    meta-toolchain
    meta-ide-support

But those are not tested!

You can also run generated qemu images with a command like 'runqemu qemux86'

Other commonly useful commands are:
 - 'devtool' and 'recipetool' handle common recipe tasks
 - 'bitbake-layers' handles common layer tasks
 - 'oe-pkgdata-util' handles common target package tasks
